"""
change_attitude.py: (Copter Only)
This example shows how to move/direct Copter and send commands in GUIDED_NOGPS mode using DroneKit Python.
Caution: A lot of unexpected behaviors may occur in GUIDED_NOGPS mode.
        Always watch the drone movement, and make sure that you are in dangerless environment.
        Land the drone as soon as possible when it shows any unexpected behavior.
Tested in Python 2.7.10

    Send MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW message to point vehicle at a specified heading (in degrees).

    This method sets an absolute heading by default, but you can set the `relative` parameter

    By default the yaw of the vehicle will follow the direction of travel. After setting 
    the yaw using this function there is no way to return to the default yaw "follow direction 
    of travel" behaviour (https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues/2427)
