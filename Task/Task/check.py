"""
Convenience functions for sending immediate/guided mode commands to control the Copter.

The set of commands demonstrated here include:
* MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW - set direction of the front of the Copter (latitude, longitude)
* MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI - set direction where the camera gimbal is aimed (latitude, longitude, altitude)
* MAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED - set target speed in metres/second.


The full set of available commands are listed here:
http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/copter-commands-in-guided-mode/
"""

def condition_yaw(heading, relative=False):
    """
    Send MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW message to point vehicle at a specified heading (in degrees).

    This method sets an absolute heading by default, but you can set the `relative` parameter
    to `True` to set yaw relative to the current yaw heading.

    By default the yaw of the vehicle will follow the direction of travel. After setting 
    the yaw using this function there is no way to return to the default yaw "follow direction 
    of travel" behaviour (https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues/2427)

Functions to move the vehicle to a specified position (as opposed to controlling movement by setting velocity components).

The methods include:
* goto_position_target_global_int - Sets position using SET_POSITION_TARGET_GLOBAL_INT command in 
    MAV_FRAME_GLOBAL_RELATIVE_ALT_INT frame
* goto_position_target_local_ned - Sets position using SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command in 
    MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED frame
* goto - A convenience function that can use Vehicle.simple_goto (default) or 
    goto_position_target_global_int to travel to a specific position in metres 
    North and East from the current location. 
    This method reports distance to the destination.
